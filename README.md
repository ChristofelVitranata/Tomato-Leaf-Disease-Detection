ToLeaf: Tomato Leaf Disease Detection with CNN Integration

Overview:

ToLeaf is an Android application dedicated to the early detection of tomato leaf diseases through advanced image analysis. This open-source project combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and TensorFlow Lite to classify images of tomato leaves, providing users with real-time insights into potential diseases affecting their plants.

Key Features:

Image Capture: Users can effortlessly capture images of tomato leaves using their device's camera within the application.

Real-time CNN Classification: The application integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for robust and accurate image classification, ensuring precise identification of potential tomato leaf diseases in real time.

Informative Output: The classified results are displayed on the user interface, allowing users to promptly access information about the detected disease.

External Resources: Users can further explore details about the identified disease by clicking on the result, initiating a web search for additional resources and information.

How to Use:

Capture Image: Use the "Capture Image" button to take a photo of a tomato leaf.

Real-time CNN Analysis: The application processes the captured image through a pre-trained CNN model (such as ModelVersion) using TensorFlow Lite for accurate and reliable disease classification.

View Results: The identified disease is displayed on the user interface, providing immediate insights into the health of the tomato plant.

Explore Information: Click on the displayed disease name to access external resources and learn more about the identified disease through a web search.

Technical Details:

The project leverages Android's camera functionalities for seamless image capture.

Integration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, such as ModelVersion, for enhanced image classification accuracy.

TensorFlow Lite is utilized for efficient and real-time execution of the CNN model on mobile devices.
